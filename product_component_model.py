        The lifetime of the product is mostly determined by the lifetime of the component. 
        The component can be replaced, and old components can be reused. 
        This model assumes that a product would live infinitely as long as the component keeps being replaced. 
        There should be some extra outflows of products as well (accidents), which could be modelled by a stock and death rate approach. 
        Outflow component <= or >= outflow product depending on assumptions for reuse and replacement.

        We take a similar approach to case 6 here, only the products do not have a lifetime and therefore are always elegible to get a component replacement. 

        We take the share of components that is exiting use due to product crashes and take a share for reuse according to the reuse_coeff.
